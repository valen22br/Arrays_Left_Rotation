# Arrays_Left_Rotation
Given an array of  integers and a number, perform  left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  (the number of integers) and  (the number of left rotations you must perform). 
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state.

Output Format

Print a single line of  space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing  left rotations.

Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4
Explanation

When we perform  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:

Thus, we print the array's final state as a single line of space-separated values, which is 5 1 2 3 4.
